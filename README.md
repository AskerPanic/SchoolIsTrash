# SchoolIsTrush

### I hope this project helps you get around the limitations of school computers.

### The school network blocks the website you need ï¼Ÿ

#### 1. Use a proxy to access the website.

How do school firewalls work?  

When you visit a website, you usually use http or https.  

http is the worst, it will ***expose your "clear text traffic (that is, what you are looking at)***", and hackers and routers can ***easily intercept your traffic***.  

When you enter your **password or bank card** on an **http** website, ***hackers and routers can also know it***.  

This is the reason **why "you cannot connect to a public wifi at will"**.
