# SchoolIsTrush

### I hope this project helps you get around the limitations of school computers.

### The school network blocks the website you need ï¼Ÿ

---

#### 1. Use a proxy to access the website.

***How do school firewalls work?***  

When you visit a website, you usually use http or https.  

http is the worst, it will ***expose your "clear text traffic (that is, what you are looking at)***", and hackers and routers can ***easily intercept your traffic***.  

When you enter your **password or bank card** on an **http** website, ***hackers and routers can also know it***.  

This is the reason **why "you cannot connect to a public wifi at will"**.  

---

However, **https can circumvent the "insecurity of http"**.  

https "***strongly encrypts***" all traffic, making it **impossible for hackers and routers to know your traffic**.  

(A digression: Try to **use https to access the website**. For this, we can ***turn on the "https-only" mode*** of the browser)

---

But we're going to unlock a website now. The school **is not a hacker and it has no ill intentions toward you**.  

Although https can **strongly encrypt your traffic**, the router can still ***view the URLs you visit***.  

When you try to access a website (such as `chat.openai.com`), the router will ***find that it is a blocked website***, and then ***reject and cut off your connection***.
